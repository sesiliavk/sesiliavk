# Sesilia Virdha Kezia - Data Analyst / Data Scientist
## Hi there 👋

I’m **Sesilia Virdha Kezia**, a future data scientist and analyst who is enthusiastic about using data to uncover insights and address practical issues. I like working with data visualization, data analysis, data cleaning, and predictive model development to aid in decision-making.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on utilizing machine learning, Python, and SQL to create data-driven solutions for real-world issues. Investigating how to use perceptive data analysis to enhance client experience and optimize promotional strategies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning:
  - Improving data storytelling to support better decision-making.
  - Advanced Machine Learning to improve model robustness and prediction accuracy.
  - Airflow & Docker to automate and containerize data pipelines.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with deploying data projects and automated data pipelines using Airflow.
